# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure

The `dd4tester/` package contains the asyncio Telnet client, GMCP parser,
scenario runner, persistence layer, state model, and CLI. YAML scenarios live
in `scenarios/`; keep reusable scenarios small and non-destructive. Tests are
under `tests/`, with sanitized protocol samples in `tests/fixtures/`. Generated
SQLite databases and JSONL transcripts belong in `runs/` and `transcripts/`;
both directories are intentionally ignored by Git.

Never modify the Dragons Domain IV core repository from this project.

## Development Commands

Use Python 3.12 in the local virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
python -m pytest
python -m compileall -q dd4tester tests
python -m dd4tester run scenarios/login.yaml
```

The first command installs the package and test tools. Run the full pytest and
compile checks before publishing a significant change.

## Style And Naming

Use four-space indentation, type hints, dataclasses for explicit data models,
and `snake_case` for modules, functions, variables, and event names. Use
`PascalCase` for classes. Keep protocol parsing, state reduction, storage, and
decision logic in independently testable modules. Prefer deterministic parsing
and structured JSON data over ad hoc text manipulation.

## Testing

Use pytest. Name files `test_<module>.py` and tests `test_<behavior>`. Add
sanitized fixtures for real DD4 output and never include account credentials.
Every bug fix should have a focused regression test. Network access must not be
required by the normal test suite.

## Data And Security

Record commands, responses, GMCP, derived events, state changes, and timestamps.
Send credentials through `DD4_USERNAME` and `DD4_PASSWORD`; transcript and
database records must redact them. Use direct Telnet/GMCP for primary testing
and reserve Mudlet-in-VM automation for client-specific validation.

## Commits And Pull Requests

Use concise imperative commit subjects, for example `Persist character state
snapshots`. Include verification details and behavioral impact in pull
requests. After every significant verified change, commit and push the complete
intended scope to the configured GitHub remote. Never push generated run data,
transcripts, secrets, or unrelated user changes.
