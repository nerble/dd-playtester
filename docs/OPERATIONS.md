# Operating Instructions

## Commentary And Discord

Append every new user steering message and every visible assistant update or
final response verbatim to `DEVELOPMENT_CONVERSATION.txt`. Do not append internal
goal continuations or injected environment context as user speech. Never rewrite
this append-only file or replay historical entries to Discord.

Before publishing commentary, run:

```powershell
python tools/conversation_log.py append --speaker "CODEX COMMENTARY" --body "Exact update text"
```

Publish the exact returned header and the same body. Use `USER` for user turns
and `CODEX FINAL` for the final response. Headers must be exactly:

```text
[YYYY-MM-DD h:mm:ss AM/PM NZST] CODEX COMMENTARY
[YYYY-MM-DD h:mm:ss AM/PM NZST] USER
[YYYY-MM-DD h:mm:ss AM/PM NZST] CODEX FINAL
```

Use current Pacific/Auckland time, literal uppercase AM/PM, and the helper's
timezone label. Never nest another timestamped speaker header inside a body.
Provide informative progress updates about every 30 seconds during long work.
Validate format with `python tools/conversation_log.py validate`.

Keep the separate streamer in `--new-only` mode with historical replay disabled.
Do not kill it during gameplay-worker cleanup. Never reset its offset to zero.
After a logging repair, verify the new USER record exists locally, the streamer
logged successful USER delivery, and its queue is empty at the source EOF.
An absent local USER record cannot be repaired by restarting Discord delivery.
The preserved instruction archive contains the full no-rewind, timestamp,
content-deduplication, and at-most-once delivery contract; consult it before
editing the streamer. Launch background helpers hidden, without console windows.

## Authorization And Fail-Fast Behavior

Routine repository, source refresh, tests, live runs, and exact process audits
are already authorized. Use ordinary available tools; do not ask again or
manufacture an escalation. If an external permission review times out, retry
once promptly, then defer that operation and continue useful local work. Never
wait indefinitely for an invisible review or repeatedly poll unchanged failure.

Keep all Git changes local. No pushes, PRs, or remote merges unless a new
explicit one-off instruction overrides this policy. Attempt one local commit
at most per 24 hours, at 9:00 PM Pacific/Auckland. Bound it to 60 seconds; a
failure consumes that day's attempt. Use the current shell's native filesystem
operations and verify absolute targets before any recursive move or delete.

Refresh the DD4 source periodically, roughly daily during active work. Use a
bounded ordinary pull, preserve source pins and revision evidence, and defer
network failure rather than blocking development. Source area files and C code
are legitimate game knowledge. Never modify the upstream game to make a test pass.

## Live Sessions

Run gameplay serially until concurrent validation proves the shared-database
boundary. Before launch, check for an existing gameplay worker. A tool returning
a session handle means it is still running: inspect or resume that exact handle,
not a duplicate connection. Finish required workers before ending the turn.

Use the bounded public `hero` command, not manual gameplay to manufacture proof.
Normal live segments have a 180-second cap, plus separate 60-second setup and
45-second cleanup allowances. Leave the outer timeout long enough for safe
cleanup. Reset retries and segment counts are separate explicit budgets.

Check fresh SQLite events and process state to diagnose silence. JSONL size or
stale metadata alone does not prove a hang. If a connected worker emits no
progress for 45 seconds, allow one bounded reconnect; if still silent, close
only that exact worker and preserve interruption evidence. Never kill unrelated
Python or Codex processes. An observation timeout is not proof of worker exit.

## Gameplay And Evidence

Midgaard recovery and logout belong at healer room 3054, one north of recall,
not the Mage's Laboratory. Wake to eat/drink during sleep when needed; never
change equipment asleep. Never log out in Purgatory: recover the corpse, loot,
restore gear, leave the portal, then hand off once to healer recovery.

Optimize useful kills and net XP per complete journey. Keep attacking viable
targets until a meaningful health, protection, nutrition, movement, or runtime
boundary. Do not kill below-band targets for XP, infer emptiness from one room,
or treat sanctuary expiry alone as a losing fight. Retain source risk, crowd,
consider, and observed loss gates. Repeated attempts need changed evidence.

A world-time probe may recheck a recorded city-shop obstruction once from healer
3054. Only a complete, positive off-route locator from that successful run,
with the same observed reboot, can release route cooldowns. Missing or absent
locations, cached checkpoint evidence, and actual purchase failures cannot do
so. This supersedes kill-only aging for that positive revalidation case, not
the normal shop preflight or any combat-loss gate. No additional wait, segment,
loan, or purchase is authorized by the probe.

Flight-shopping transit can use the existing source-bounded greeter assessment
with fresh departure readiness. Permit only one isolated, exact source-VNUM
interruption in the registered city route, with source-level/HP limits, a 70%
character-health floor, nutrition, and a 60-second deadline. Normal segment
cleanup still takes precedence. Persist `campaign_city_shop_transit` outcomes,
not a resumable combat timer. A failed transit denies the same-level/reboot
allowance; missing reboot evidence cannot reopen it. Bind a short run's missing
stamp to the campaign's known reboot when merging fresh evidence. Do not erase
field losses, reopen real purchase failures, add loans, or count these weak
defensive kills as objective XP.

Use exact source keywords and connection-local target IDs. Mobile, object,
room, and object-set VNUM namespaces are distinct. Never restore pending
commands, companion ownership, or timing rights from saved checkpoints.
Register and test skills before dispatch; positive practice, equipment,
resources, target state, and safety gates remain mandatory. Honor existing
gear-mode, provision, corpse, trainer, and prerequisite contracts in the archive.

Record raw input beside derived observations, reject malformed enemy snapshots
without erasing combat, and retain real loss/death history. Flush SQLite event
batches before asynchronous waits. Use indexed, bounded read-only queries for
inspection; do not scan entire transcripts or giant checkpoint histories.

Reconstruct source circuits by observed stop identity, not only segment phase.
Use the authoritative run kill ledger, including explicit empty results. A
secondary kill must not promote the headline or inherit another stop's crowd.
Preserve newer negative results, whole-run death/failure, and actual segment
reboot scope. Do not let inherited result metadata override that scope.
Revision-242-and-newer terminal records already contain per-stop results; the
legacy consider migration must not rebuild them and resurrect old failures.

Crowd assessment shares the existing three-probe, five-second-response budget
across single and repeated mobile identities. Require complete, unique live
selectors and source-identified ordinary mobiles. Only an exact source consider
response at or below the -5 band discounts that instance; unknown, refused,
expired or changed instances remain material. Another target's consider is
never attack authorization. Preserve level/reboot/room scope and all combat-loss
gates. Pin an ongoing source fight to its considered instance across GMCP name
changes and room refreshes; never redirect it to a same-name replacement.
Telnet GMCP currently repeats
the primary enemy record for some other combat participants, so duplicated
records do not provide authoritative identities or levels for those attackers.

An ordinary unarmed pair may use the source-estimated encounter envelope only
after two exact, fresh easy-kill considers and the normal route/target gates.
Require near-full health, source HP/peak bounds, executable class damage, and
mana priced by observed practice, not the spell's minimum alone. Retain the
source estimate as an estimate: compare combined incoming damage with measured
output while preserving emergency, unknown-attacker, and runtime exits. Both
kills share one 45-second/action budget and the original exact selectors.
If the second target has not joined, refresh and consider it normally. Movement,
disconnect, level/reboot change, or expiry discards the allowance. Persist only
audit outcomes under `campaign_fastwalk_encounter_budgets`, never reusable IDs
or combat permission. Do not erase crowd/loss evidence to force live admission.

## Documentation

`README.md` is current usage; `ROADMAP.md` is delivery gates. Dated reviews hold
analysis and run evidence. `docs/history/` preserves prior documents without
making their old "latest" sections authoritative. Update current facts once
in the active review rather than copying every run into all three root files.
